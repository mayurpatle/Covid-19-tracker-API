# Covid-19-tracker-API

This code defines two functions: get_country_data and plot_country_data. The get_country_data function sends a request to the COVID-19 API and retrieves the latest statistics for a given country. It then returns a dictionary containing the relevant data (country name, confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries).

The plot_country_data function also sends a request to the COVID-19 API and retrieves the historical data for a given country. It then plots the data using the matplotlib library.

The example usage section demonstrates how to use these functions to get and display COVID-19 statistics for the United States. You can modify the country variable to get statistics for a different country.
